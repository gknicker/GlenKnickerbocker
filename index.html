<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<ul>
	<li><pre>Dec 8, 2019</pre><h4>Jake Rosenbalm, Chief Information Officer, Oregon Department of Energy</h4>Glen Knickerbocker was chosen from a group of twenty-nine contractors to work for the Department of Energy as a .NET developer in 2019.
		We had several legacy ASP and ASP.NET applications with significant issues from previous development efforts that had left the agency with supplementary shadow systems in addition to the web applications with issues.
		<br /><br />Glen was able to resolve the outstanding bugs, clean up a significant portion of the applications, and provide much requested enhancements to the applications allowing for the retirement of the shadow systems.
		He was able to prioritize the work items to ensure the critical and highly important issues were resolved within the contract timeframe. We were very impressed with the work Glen delivered on our behalf and will continue to reach out to him for .NET support in the future.
		<br /><br />Beyond the technical, Glen is an absolute pleasure to work with. Both management and customer alike have enjoyed working with him. Glen can communicate well at both the technical and business level.
		I would recommend partnering with Glen on any development effort.</li>
	<li><pre>Jan 23, 2019</pre><h4>Paulette Jaeger, Technical Team Lead, Oregon Dept of Human Services</h4>My name is Paulette Jaeger and I have known and worked with Glen ("Nick") Knickerbocker for 15 years.
		We initially worked together while he was employed with the State of Oregon Office of Information Systems as the system architect on the eXPRS Payment and Reporting System in 2004. The entire application was built inhouse in large part due to Nick’s expertise and leadership.
		Once the application had been deployed to production and turned over to operations and maintenance he left to become an independent contractor. He returned to work with the team on five different contracts for new enhancement efforts. Each time he returned he was an asset from the start.
		I currently lead the team of developers for that application and continue to appreciate the hard work that went into the architecture which has been a proven foundation of the system since its origin.
		<br /><br />Nick has truly always been willing to work diligently and tirelessly to build the application and individual modules to meet the needs of the business at all levels, even when that need changed multiple times.
		He consistently has a positive attitude, been willing to mentor team members of any level, and communicates in a manner which leaves everyone energized and eager to work on tasks.
		I cannot express enough how much I value and have appreciated Nick’s expertise and commitment over the years to build a sustainable payment system. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance.</li>
	<li><pre>Jan 16, 2019</pre><h4>Frank Calfo, Senior Software Engineer, Nike</h4>I worked closely with Glen ("Nick") Knickerbocker for about 1 1/2 years on a project to build a new claims system for the State of Oregon and during that time we got to know each other pretty well.
		Nick is a very creative, enthusiastic, intelligent person who brings a lot of positive energy to every project he is involved with. He is especially gifted in designing robust, testable, maintainable, simple software solutions to complex business problems.
		He has a very strong work ethic and will go to great lengths to achieve the goals of the project. He is very trustworthy, dedicated to high levels of quality, a good listener, and open minded. Nick has always been very respectful of every person on the team and is good at building relationships and giving every person on the team a voice in the project.
		He naturally assumes the best of people. Nick is a great person to work with and the kind of person who excels at anything he puts his mind to. I am confident that he will do an excellent job for you!</li>
	<li><pre>Jan 15, 2019</pre><h4>Nathan Theophanes, President, Sembit Corp.</h4>I have worked with Glen ("Nick") Knickerbocker for 7 years. He is a strong full-stack developer with experience in both Java and Microsoft technologies, various database systems, and several Javascript frameworks.
		He has architected and led development on many projects for us, and he is also willing to dive into older code and systems for integration or modification purposes, as needed. He is a hard worker with an excellent attitude, able to put in many hours when called for.
		I highly recommend Nick for any project requiring senior expertise and development skill.</li>
